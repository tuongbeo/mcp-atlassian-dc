# Test scenarios for AttachmentsMixin
#
# 1. Single Attachment Upload (upload_attachment method):
#    - Success case: Uploads attachment correctly
#    - Path handling: Converts relative path to absolute path
#    - Error cases:
#      - No content ID provided
#      - No file path provided
#      - File not found
#      - API error during upload
#
# 2. Multiple Attachments Upload (upload_attachments method):
#    - Success case: Uploads multiple files correctly
#    - Partial success: Some files upload successfully, others fail
#    - Error cases:
#      - Empty list of file paths
#      - No content ID provided
#
# 3. Single Attachment Download (download_attachment method):
#    - Success case: Downloads attachment correctly with proper HTTP response
#    - Path handling: Converts relative path to absolute path
#    - Error cases:
#      - No URL provided
#      - HTTP error during download
#      - File write error
#      - File not created after write operation
#
# 4. Content Attachments Download (download_content_attachments method):
#    - Success case: Downloads all attachments for content
#    - Path handling: Converts relative target directory to absolute path
#    - Edge cases:
#      - Content has no attachments
#      - API error retrieving attachments
#      - Some attachments fail to download
#      - Attachment has missing download URL
#
# 5. Get Content Attachments (get_content_attachments method):
#    - Success case: Retrieves all attachments for content
#    - Pagination: Handles paginated results
#    - Error cases:
#      - No content ID provided
#      - API error retrieving attachments
#      - Empty results
